# Alice 6 Layer

This isn't really the Ergosaurus per se, nor is it the Lubrigante of which the Ergosaurus is based on. I am putting this design up as an angled front Lubrigante with a more high compatibility plate, that people can easily order from Ponoko. 

Note: This case will not work with the Ergosaurus PCB due to clearance issues with the pro micro. It should work for most Alice PCBs, the same as the Lubrigante. When you upload it to Ponoko the dimensions should read 348.8 mm wide.

If you want a simple color, and want to use M3x20 screws, that's gonna be your best bet. Stop paying 420 Euros for acrylic cases.

At the time of this upload, here are the prices from Ponoko if you want to order it yourself:

As low as $45! There will be a $9 one-time setup fee, but with multiple item discounts, if you find someone to go in on it with you, it essentially goes away. Hope this helps someone.
